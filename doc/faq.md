# FAQ

- Why GitLab?

We migrated to GitLab back when GitHub did not support free private repos and have
stuck with it since. It’s prettier and supports lots of great features (many of
which have since been added to GitHub), including docker registries, rebasing via UI,
and auto-merge-when-CI-passes.

- Why React?

Django templates come with lots of great features, but statically rendered HTML is hard
to customize. React allowed us to add many JS-first bells and whistles like confetti,
copy-to-clipboard, and other interactive, client-side elements.

- Why NextJS?

Many of our teammates use NextJS for work. While it’s opinionated, we find that it’s very
intuitive and a great developer experience (e.g. routing based on path, simple scaffolding).
It also has bonus features like server-side rendering and image optimization built-in.

- Why tph-site?

Even though “Teammate Hunt” does not include the word “puzzle,” we’ve stuck with this
abbreviation throughout our codebase as an homage to gph-site. And because it’s a pain
to refactor legacy code.
